Basics of perfectionism philosophy.
Thesis one: The more complexity the better.
    Note 1:
     By complexity meant not quantity, but quality.
    Consequence 1:
      Nature сonsidered as wealth and sample, because its creations are always more complex than man-made creations.
       Note 2: nature сonsidered as wealth, until it can't be repeated by humans.
    Consequence 3:
      Chaos is considered to be an object of delight, because chaos creations are always unique.
      Note 3: Chaos is considered to be an object of delight, but human creations should not seek chaos.
    Consequence 2:
      The main criterion of art should be originality, because creating new things is always harder than combining some existing things.
    Consequence 3:
      Activities should be cognitive and interesting, because development of every single human, develops all the civilization.
      Note 4: by civilization meant a copulation of knowledge in society, which is not a part of a bigger one.
    Consequence 4:
      Work should not be routine, because the more complex creation should solve more complex puzzles.
      Human can provide such things like ideas, while machines cannot do this, so humans 
      should explore and create, while machines do the less complex work.
