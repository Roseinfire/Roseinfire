Hello, 
    I'm a sixteen years old Ukrainian, whose family still can't escape Russia.
    When the war started, my parents and sister, we all were affected. Nobody of us
    never visited any country, we do not have a lot of money and have no international documents.

    In the first weeks, my father said we must leave the country in four months.
    But we didn't leave Russia in May and August and October and December.
    One YEAR passed. Mission is getting harder from day to day.
   
    My family says I should continue learning in Russia. I have difficulties due to the war.
    I hate the war, but to do ANYTHING against Russia is DANGEROUS if you want to ever leave the country.
   
    I'm confused. I'm falling in the darkness.
    Feels like being in the end of Jack London's "To build a fire"
