  Thesis one: The more complexity the better.
    Note 1:
     By complexity meant not quantity, but quality.
    Consequence 1:
      Nature сonsidered as wealth and sample, because its creations are always more complex than man-made creations.
       Note 2: nature сonsidered as wealth, until it can't be repeated by humans.
    Consequence 3:
      Chaos is considered to be an object of delight, because chaos creations are always unique.
      Note 3: Chaos is considered to be an object of delight, but human creations should not seek chaos.
    Consequence 2:
      The main criterion of art should be originality, because creating new things is always harder than combining some existing things.
    Consequence 3:
      Activities should be cognitive and interesting, because development of every single human, develops all the civilization.
      Note 4: by civilization meant a copulation of knowledge in society, which is not a part of a bigger one. *div .floating
